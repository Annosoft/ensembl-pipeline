ONLY MAJOR CHANGES and hotfixes are commited to ensembl-pipeline CVS.

Full change history is in git at:
http://git.internal.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=anacode/assembly_mapper.git

The scripts should be run in the following order for each mapping
task:

 - new_align_session.pl           [creates align_session and
                                   align_stage tables if required]

 - align_by_component_identity.pl [creates tmp_align and tmp_mask
                                   tables if not present         ]

 - check_repeat_masked.pl         [be sure to fix any identified
                                   repeat-mask analysis gaps     ]

 - align_nonident.pl

 - add_extra_mappings.pl          [optional]

 - fix_overlaps.pl

 - transfer_annotation.pl         [if required]

Correct ordering is enforced via entries in (and checks on) the
align_session and align_stage tables.

The '--force-stage' argument can be used to bypass stage checking, but
note that new_align_session.pl must be run, and that entries in the
tmp_align table are now keyed on the corresponding align_session
entry.

As a consequence it is no longer necessary to drop the the tmp_align
and tmp_mask tables between mapping sessions on the same
database. Concurrent mapping sessions are now possible.

The '--skip_create_stage' argument can be used to inhibit writing of a
stage entry into the align_stage table.
