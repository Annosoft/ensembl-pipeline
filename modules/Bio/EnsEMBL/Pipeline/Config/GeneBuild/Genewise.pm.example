=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Pipeline::Config::GeneBuild::Genewise - imports global variables used by EnsEMBL gene building

=head1 SYNOPSIS
    use Bio::EnsEMBL::Pipeline::Config::GeneBuild::Genewise;
    use Bio::EnsEMBL::Pipeline::Config::GeneBuild::Genewise qw(  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Genewise is a pure ripoff of humConf written by James Gilbert.

humConf is based upon ideas from the standard perl Env environment
module.

It imports and sets a number of standard global variables into the
calling package, which are used in many scripts in the human sequence
analysis system.  The variables are first decalared using "use vars",
so that it can be used when "use strict" is in use in the calling
script.  Without arguments all the standard variables are set, and
with a list, only those variables whose names are provided are set.
The module will die if a variable which doesn\'t appear in its
C<%Genewise> hash is asked to be set.

The variables can also be references to arrays or hashes.

Edit C<%Genewise> to add or alter variables.

All the variables are in capitals, so that they resemble environment
variables.

#standard values used for most genebuilds
# it is probably best not to change them, for some organisms we change them e.g for briggsae we increased

#just as likely as normal long gaps weren't
