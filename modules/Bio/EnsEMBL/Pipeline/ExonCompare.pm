=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Pipeline::ExonCompare - Comparison of an exon against an array of exons

=head1 SYNOPSIS

$self->{'_standardExon'} is an exon being compared to an array of exons stored in
@{$self->{'_predictorExons'}}.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module represents a class that is used for gene comparison. It is a specialisation 
of Bio::Root::RootI. The constructor (new method) takes an array of exons which is stored
in the @{$self->{'_predictorExons'}} property. These are the exons against which all 
comparisons are made. The standard exon is set by the setStandardExon method. Four methods
perform comparisons between the standard exon and the array of predictor exons:
hasOverlap, hasExactOverlap, getOverlaps and getBaseOverlaps.

=head2 hasOverlap

 Title   : hasOverlap
 Usage   : $overlap = $obj->hasOverlap()
 Function: Checks if any of the predictor exons have an overlap with the standard exon.
 Example :

    }
    
    return 0;

=head2 hasExactOverlap

 Title   : hasExactOverlap
 Usage   : $obj->hasExactOverlap()
 Function: Checks if any of the predictor exons exactly overlaps the standard exon.
 Example : 
 Returns : 0 if none of the predictor exons exactly matches the standard exon, otherwise 1.
 Args    :

=head2 getOverlaps

 Title   : getOverlaps
 Usage   : $obj->getOverlaps()
 Function: Find all the predictor exons that the standard exons overlaps 
            adds them to an array and returns it.
 Example : 
 Returns : An array of references to Bio::EnsEMBL::Exon.
 Args    :

=head2 getBaseOverlaps

 Title   : getBaseOverlaps
 Usage   : $obj->getBaseOverlaps()
 Function: Calculates the number of bases involved in true positive, true negative
            and false positive overlaps between the standard exon and overlapping predictor exons. 
            True positive means that a standard base is found on a predictor exon;
            false negative means that a standard base is not found on a predictor exon;
            false positve means that a base is found on an overlapping predictor exon
            but not on the standard exon.
 Example : 
 Returns : List of 3 integers.
 Args    :
