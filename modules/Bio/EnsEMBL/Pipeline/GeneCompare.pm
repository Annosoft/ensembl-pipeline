=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Pipeline::GeneCompare - Comparison of a gene against an array of genes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

$self->{'_standardExons'} is an array of exons found on the standard gene.
These are compared to the array of exons found on the genes stored in
@{$self->{'_predictorGenes'}}.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module represents a class that is used for gene comparison. It is a specialisation 
of Bio::Root::RootI. The constructor (new method) takes an array of genes which is stored
in the @{$self->{'_predictorGenes'}} property. These are the genes against which all 
comparisons are made. An array of exons on these genes is obtained by calling the
_getPredictorExons method. The standard gene is set by the setStandardGene method which
finds all the standard exons and stores them in the $self->{'_standardExons'} property. 

Various methods perform comparisons between the standard gene and the array of predictor genes
by in turn creating objects of the class Bio::EnsEMBL::Pipeline::ExonCompare and calling
appropriate methods on these:

isMissed returns 1 if none of the exons on the standard gene are overlapped by the predictor genes.
isExactlyMatched returns 1 if all the exons on the standard gene are exactly identified 
by only one of the predictor genes.
getGeneOverlapCount returns the number of predictor genes that the standard gene overlaps. 
getExactOverlapRatio returns a list. The first item is the number of exons on the standard 
gene that are exactly overlapped; the second is the number that are not.
getMissed returns the number of standard exons which are not overlapped by predictor exons.
getExonOverlaps returns an array containing predictor exons which the standard gene overlaps.
getBaseOverlaps returns the number of bases on the standard gene that have true positive, true negative
and false positive overlaps with all the overlapping exons from the predictor genes.
