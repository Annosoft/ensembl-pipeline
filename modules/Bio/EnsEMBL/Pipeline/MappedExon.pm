=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Pipeline::MappedExon

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Extension of a normal exon that knows whether its DNA 
sequence has changed from the previous version.

Usage is the same for Bio::EnsEMBL::Exon except we have one
new method 

  $exon->has_identical_sequence(0)  # Sequence not identical to last version

  or

  $exon->has_identical_sequence(1)  # Sequence is the same as the last version

  and

  my $changed = $exon->has_identical_sequence


=head1 CONTACT

=head1 APPENDIX

The rest of the documentation details each of the object methods. Internal methods are usually preceded with a _

# Let the code begin...

    my $make = $self->SUPER::_initialize(@args);
