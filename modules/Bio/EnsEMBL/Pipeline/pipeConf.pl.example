# configuration information
# give useful keynames to things

# if states are involved maybe good to have statenames in key.
# parameters should be avail after compile time so
# that you can make changes at runtime.

# some of these options can be specified on the command line (e.g. to
# the RuleManager script) and will override these defaults.
# it may also be possible to specify environment variables like
# ENS_<OPT> (these will be overridden by the settings below).
